now I need the system of the cutman and the trainer to be enhanced in a fight, undisputed video game style. Madden type franchise two player career system

Perfect. Now **integration steps** for your fight scene:

## Wiring Corner System Into Fight Scene

Add this to your Phaser fight scene's `update()` loop (replaces previous endRound):

```javascript
// In FightScene after round ends
async function endRound() {
  gameState.fight.round++;

  // Initialize corner handler
  const cornerHandler = new CornerHandler(gameState, cornerSystemJSON);

  // Show between-round UI (60 sec)
  const cornerResult = await cornerHandler.startBetweenRoundUI(
    this, // Phaser scene context
    gameState.fight.round,
    gameState.fighters[selectedFighter],
    gameState.fight.opponent
  );

  // Apply coach instruction to next round (modifies damage multipliers)
  const modifiers = cornerHandler.getInstructionModifiers(cornerResult.instruction);
  applyRoundModifiers(modifiers);

  // Resume fight
  simulateNextRound();
}
```

## Two-Player Franchise Setup

In your `index.html` or GlassFist main menu:

```html
<button onclick="initiateTwoPlayerFranchise()">
  👥 Two-Player Franchise Mode
</button>

<script>
function initiateTwoPlayerFranchise() {
  const p1 = { name: prompt("Player 1 Name?"), fighters: [], budget: 50000 };
  const p2 = { name: prompt("Player 2 Name?"), fighters: [], budget: 50000 };
  
  const cornerHandler = new CornerHandler({});
  const franchise = cornerHandler.setupTwoPlayerCareer(p1, p2);
  
  localStorage.setItem('gfm-franchise', JSON.stringify(franchise));
  window.location.href = '#franchise-view';
}
</script>
```

## Files Summary

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `corner_system.json` | 553-line config: staff, strategies, injuries, franchise mechanics |
| `corner_handler.js` | JS class: between-round UI, treatments, coach AI, two-player integration |
| Your GlassFist HTML | Wire via `<script src="corner_handler.js"></script>` + call `cornerHandler.startBetweenRoundUI()` after each round |

**Result**: Full Undisputed/Madden corner experience—trainer gives strategy prompts, cutman manages cuts/swelling, nutrition restores stamina, two players manage separate rosters with shared franchise calendar.[1][2][3][4]
