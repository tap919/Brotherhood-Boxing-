can you give me a json of nuances of game development that this game will need that may not be central to boxing but will help the overall user experience and graphics

Here's a JSON of 50+ game development nuances tailored for your GlassFist boxing manager/fight sim. These focus on polish "juice" (e.g., particles, shakes) and UX/graphics refinements that boost perceived quality/feedback—non-core to boxing but essential for retention/graphics pop in Phaser/HTML5 setups.[1][2][3][4]

## Core JSON
Embed as `gamePolish.json` and load in Phaser (`this.cache.json.get('polish')`) or JS for procedural effects. Each item includes Phaser snippets for your fight scene.[5]

## Implementation Priority
Focus graphics first (shake/particles add 80% juice impact), then UX (menu polish retains players). Test on low-spec (your DataLite project).[6][7]

| Category | Quick Wins (5min) | High Impact (30min) |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Graphics | Hit flash, shake | Particles, bloom[2] |
| UX | Button tween | Pause overlay |
| Audio | Pitch rand | Layered SFX |

Apply to roster/gym tabs for manager cohesion; yields pro feel without boxing changes.[3][8]
